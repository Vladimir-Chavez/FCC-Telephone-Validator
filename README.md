# FCC-Telephone-Validator
Project for freecodecamp.org. This is a simple US Phone validator. The algorithm validates or rejects the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.

##Completed and submitted
Will see about actually applying an OOP model to the code later on in an attempt to better understand js Objects.
